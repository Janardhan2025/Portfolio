First of all, I really thank you for giving me a wonderful opportunity to introduce myself. A warm good morning to one and all.

My name is Kondapalli Venkat Sai Janardhan Rao. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at SR University, Telangana, with a CGPA of 7.5. I completed my intermediate education at Harvest Co-Operative Junior College, and my schooling at Harvest Public School.

Coming to my family background, my father's name is K. Sreedhar Rao, and he is a government employee. My mother's name is K. Sandhya, and she is a homemaker.

I'm a passionate learner with a strong interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. I've worked on projects such as a Bank Management System using C, JavaScript, and MySQL, and a House Price Prediction model using Python and machine learning algorithms. I also have a published patent for a Security Management System for Public Transit Stations, which integrates smart surveillance and threat detection technologies.

I've completed virtual internships through AICTE, including Java Full Stack Development, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, and Android Development, gaining hands-on experience in modern tools and technologies.

My technical skills include C, Java, Python, JavaScript, and tools like React, MySQL, Scikit-learn. I'm also certified in AWS Cloud Computing, Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals, and Computer Networks by Cisco.

My goal is to become a successful software developer, contributing to innovative solutions and meaningful research in the tech industry.

In my free time, I enjoy reading newspapers, watering plants, and exploring new technologies. Two of my favorite hobbies are playing chess and listening to music, which help me stay focused and relaxed.

Once again, thank you for this opportunity. I'm truly excited to continue learning and growing in the field of technology.
